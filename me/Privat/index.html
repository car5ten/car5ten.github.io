Today, these interests, especially those concerning computers, the internet, and video games, continue to be a part of my life. During my gaming sessions, I spend a lot of time on the internet, constantly experimenting with new things. It all started with creating a simple website. After that, I developed small programs and scripts that helped me with various tasks on my PC. With my entry into the world of software development, I found my passion as an iOS developer (obviously ðŸ˜‰).</p><h3></h3><p>In addition to software development, I also have hobbies that I practice to varying degrees of proficiency, such as graphic design, creating 3D models for my 3D printer, baking muffins and cakes, playing Yo-Yo, and binge-watching every single episode of Doctor Who. Outside my four walls, I enjoy going bouldering with friends, occasionally strolling through flea markets, and taking beach walks in my hometown.</p><h3></h3><p>Furthermore, I've recently become fascinated by everything related to AI. In addition to experimenting with image generation, I plan to train my own LLM for a personal project, which can then be used as a chatbot in an app. Currently, I have several other small projects in the pipeline.</p></div></article></div></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p></footer></body></html>
