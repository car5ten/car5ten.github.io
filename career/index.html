Currently, I'm using the opportunity to enhance my skills in <strong>SwiftUI</strong>, employing a combination of <strong>MVVM</strong>, <strong>Clean Architecture</strong>, and <strong>Reactive Programming</strong>.</p></article></li><li><article><h1><strong>Check24 MÃ¶bel</strong></h1><h3>May 2020 - Nov 2020</h3><p>Given the early stage of the developed app, I established the <strong>MVVM</strong> architecture as the foundation. Collaborating with the team, we refactored existing features to align with MVVM principles. My significant contribution included leading the development of the startup, product detail, and category screens. With the objective of remaining independent of third-party libraries, we collectively implemented a custom <strong>Reactive Programming</strong> solution within the team.</p></article></li><li><article><h1><strong>iconmobile</strong></h1><h3>May 2014 - May 2020</h3><p>During my time as a student worker and in a full-time role, I contributed to various projects and prototype developments, conducted thorough research on diverse topics, and engaged in comprehensive app benchmarking. While working on the development of new features across different projects, I began using <strong>Swift from version 1.0</strong> onward. I gained hands-on experience with various architectural paradigms, although most apps during that period primarily utilized either <strong>MVC</strong>, a customized MVC variant, or <strong>MVVM</strong>.</p><h3></h3><p>The most significant milestone in my career at iconmobile was proving myself in the role of Lead in a client project, where, as a team, we successfully achieved our project goals.</p><h3></h3><p>Some of the particularly exciting projects I had the opportunity to work on include:</p><ul><li>Oral-B versions 3.0 to 5.1</li><li>Oral-B Smart Mirror Prototype</li><li>We Park</li><li>Henkel SalonLab</li></ul></article></li><li><article><h1><strong>Master of Science</strong></h1><h3>March 2017</h3><p>The focus of my master's thesis was on exploiting the error correction capabilities of QR codes. Leveraging the acquired knowledge, I developed a library for Android and iOS, enabling users to personalize the black modules of a QR code with their images. This involved intentionally introducing errors into the QR code to optimize the representation of the embedded image. I successfully completed my master's degree study at Beuth University of Applied Sciences in Berlin with an overall grade of "<strong>very good</strong>".</p></article></li></ul></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p></footer></body></html>
