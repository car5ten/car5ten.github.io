While working on the development of new features across different projects, I began using <strong>Swift from version 1.0</strong> onward. I gained hands-on experience with various architectural paradigms, although most apps during that period primarily utilized either <strong>MVC</strong>, a customized MVC variant, or <strong>MVVM</strong>.</p><h3></h3><p>The most significant milestone in my career at iconmobile was proving myself in the role of Lead in a client project, where, as a team, we successfully achieved our project goals.</p><h3></h3><p>Some of the particularly exciting projects I had the opportunity to work on include:</p><ul><li>Oral-B versions 3.0 to 5.1</li><li>Oral-B Smart Mirror Prototype</li><li>We Park</li><li>Henkel SalonLab</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://carsten.dev/me/Privat</guid><title>What I do outside of work</title><description></description><link>https://carsten.dev/me/Privat</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>What I do outside of work</strong></h1><p>As a teenager, I was already passionate about things related to computers and the internet. It all started with creating a simple website. After that, I developed small programs and scripts that helped me with various tasks on my PC. With my entry into the world of software development, I found my passion as an iOS developer. ( obviously ;) )</p><h3></h3><p>In addition to software development, I also have hobbies that I practice to varying degrees of proficiency, such as graphic design, creating 3D models for my 3D printer, play board games, baking muffins and cakes, playing Yo-Yo, and binge-watching every single episode of Doctor Who. Outside my four walls, I enjoy going bouldering with friends, occasionally strolling through flea markets, and taking beach walks in my hometown.</p><h3></h3><p>Furthermore, I've recently become fascinated by everything related to AI and experimenting with image generation. Currently, I'm working on a small App which informs about the diversity of nature, environmental, climate and sustainability education in Berlin.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://carsten.dev/career/Beuth</guid><title>Master of Science</title><description></description><link>https://carsten.dev/career/Beuth</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Master of Science</strong></h1><h3>March 2017</h3><p>The focus of my master's thesis was on exploiting the error correction capabilities of QR codes. Leveraging the acquired knowledge, I developed a library for Android and iOS, enabling users to personalize the black modules of a QR code with their images. This involved intentionally introducing errors into the QR code to optimize the representation of the embedded image. I successfully completed my master's degree study at Beuth University of Applied Sciences in Berlin with an overall grade of "<strong>very good</strong>".</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
